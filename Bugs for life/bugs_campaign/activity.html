          <blockquote>
            <p>The world is facing a food crisis the scale of which truly begs the question “How to be OK in the future.” Craig’s answer may be unpalatable to many of us – insects.<p/> 
          <p>Craig helped found Bugs For Life and has become a pioneer of entomophagy (bug eating) as a solution to growing pressure on food production. In addition to an elucidating talk from Craig, the Bugs For Life team host an Interactive Space at the event, with unusual canapés on offer.</p>

          <p>
          Bugs for Life were invited to talk and serve some gourmet buggy treats at the TEDx event in Edinburgh February 2015. We were very privileged and honoured to be at this event to say the least; many thanks to those who made this happen and alo to those who were there to listen in and try our beautiful food.</p>
          <p>  Our subject focused on insect farming and the consumption of insects in a rapidly growing population - very interesting indeed. Please view the talk below.

          <h2>Exploring Entomophagy in North Benin</h3>
          <p>
          Exploring Entomophagy in North Benin was the research project that Bugs for Life was created around. Our aim was to undertake a study in Benin, West Africa on the use of edible insects as a potential source of protein in a food insecure area. The study focused on the local practice of entomophagy in the Wama communities of the Atakora (Northern Benin). In particular, Bugs for Life explored the traditional role of edible insects and the potential for the expansion of this practice in order to improve the nutritional status of the population, and in particular of children.
          </p>
          <p>The undertaking of this research project was made possible by establishing contact with Severin Tchibozo from the NGO Centre for Research on Biodiversity Management, who became our local partner in Benin. Funding was secured through grants by Imperial College Expedition Board, the Royal Entomological Society, along with crowd-funding via Indiegogo.</p>

                <p>Hello from Northern Ireland! Bugs for Life and Society of Biology collaborated together at this fantastic science festival. Our theme was 'Menu of the Future', which focused on showing people how to cook insects and incorporate them into their regular diet. We had an enthusiastic audience who were very intrigued by our food. We received a very positive response and we were fetured in<a href="http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/life/food-drink/insectbased-dishes-on-menu-at-st-georges-market-31003812.html"> The Belfast Telegraph</a> and <a href="http://lovebelfast.co.uk/2015/02/18/belfast-to-try-insects-as-part-of-menu-of-the-future/">Love Belfast.</a> </p>

                <p>Insect eating has gained popularity as a curious culinary way to address environmental sustainability. These little edible bugs surprise, fascinate and inspire... but one question remains: if insects are good for us to eat - how can we use them to create tasty recipes? The Future of Food stall was created as a space to share knowledge on edible insects, meet a few edible creepy crawlies, to get to know all their curious properties, to learn to start your own insect farm in your living room, and discover or come up with insect recipes ideas! </p>

In particular Bugs for Life presented their work in Benin, West Africa, where the team has spent some time learning about (and feasting on!) these little yummy snacks as a secret trick against child malnutrition. </p>
