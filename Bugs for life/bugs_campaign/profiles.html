          <h4>Laura Riggi </h4>
          <p>Laura is a bug lover and an ecologist, currently working on promoting beneficial insects in agricultural systems in Sweden. After graduating in Biology at the University of Edinburgh she organised a summer expedition to Mexico on orchid bees in coffee agro-systems and then continued travelling around Europe as a field assistant, collecting gall wasps. After a bug filled gap year, in 2011, she completed a Master in Crop Pest Management at Imperial College London where she got the munchies for entomophagy and co-lead the Bugs for Life project investigating edible insects in North Benin which turned out to be quite an adventure!</p>

          <h4>Rudi Verspoor </h4>
          <p>Rudi has loved insects and spiders since he was young. After graduating in biology at the University of Edinburgh he has been involved in projects looking at orchid bees, social spiders, and the urban ecology of pollinators. Alongside his work he also has a passion for insect photography. More recently he has completed a Masters in Entomology at Imperial College London which led him to become a member of the Bugs for Life team for their first trip out to Northern Benin in 2012. More recently, Rudi is studying a PhD at the University of Liverpool using insects to understand the biology of selfish genetic elements.</p>

          <h4>Mariangela Veronesi</h4>
          <p>Mariangela has a background in international development and specialised in environmental planning at the UCL Development Planning Unit. After looking at food security under various angles, including fieldwork in Ghana on urban agriculture, Mariangela came across edible insects. These little bugs seemed like the perfect resource to consider! Being part of Bugs for Life has created the opportunity to explore this further and led onto establishing great relations with the communities in Benin and many other ento-lovers across the world. When shes not plunged in the world of entomophagy she focuses her work on community driven solution to urban environmental problems in the Global South. </p>
